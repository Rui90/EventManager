### Pro agil

Basic web api that uses .NET Core 3.1 with Entity Framework 3.1 and creates it's first table with two get endpoints to access it.

Also created a basic application on Angular 9 with bootstrap and fortawesome that connects to the web api.

Identity Server will be added in the next couple days within some extra features.
